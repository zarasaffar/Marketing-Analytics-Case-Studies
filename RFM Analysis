An RFM analysis explores questions like,
who are my best customers? 
Which customers have potential to spend more? 
Which customers should we pay less attention to? 
To answer these questions, RFM looks at recency, how recently someone purchased; frequency, how often they purchase within a set time period; monetary, how much they spent within a set time period.
